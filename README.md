# 3D Modeling and Textures Painting

A comprehensive 3D modeling and texture painting project built with Unity3D. This project demonstrates advanced 3D asset creation, texture painting, and material workflows.

## Features

- Professional 3D model creation
- Advanced texture painting and UV mapping
- PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials
- Material scripting and shader customization
- Real-time lighting and rendering
- Asset optimization and LOD systems
